# Net Time Project — PhD Assessment (Coding Task)

**PhD Programme: Science & Health in Football | Saarland University**

## Overview

This repository contains the coding submission for the Net Time Project PhD assessment.
It implements three tasks using the publicly available Bundesliga dataset described in:

> Bassek, M., Rein, R., Weber, H. & Memmert, D. (2025). *An integrated dataset of
> spatiotemporal and event data in elite soccer.* Scientific Data, 12, 195.
> https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-04505-y

The dataset provides TRACAB Gen5 tracking data (25 Hz) and DFL-annotated event data
from **7 German Bundesliga matches** (2 Bundesliga 1, 5 Bundesliga 2, season 2022/23),
covering 207 players across over 1 million tracking frames.

## Tasks Covered

### Task 1 — Data Access, Parsing, and Flat DataFrames
- Custom XML parser for DFL MatchInfo files (`read_match_info_xml`)
- Wrappers around `floodlight` 0.4.0 for event and tracking data
- Flat DataFrames for all three modalities across all 7 matches

### Task 2 — Visualisations
1. Ball trajectory with BallStatus overlay (first 5 minutes)
2. Player positional heatmaps — Home vs. Away (ball-in-play frames only)
3. Event type distribution by half (top 20 event types)
4. Ball-status timeline — stoppage pattern across both halves
5. Player speed distribution — active vs. inactive play phases

### Task 3 — Net Playing Time: Two Approaches

| | Approach 1 | Approach 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Method | Frame-counting via BallStatus signal | Stoppage summation via event timestamps |
| Resolution | 40 ms (25 Hz) | ~1–2 s (human annotation) |
| Strength | Precise, continuous, objective | Causally attributed by stoppage type |
| Captures | All ball-inactive frames | Set-pieces, VAR, post-goal windows |

Both approaches are compared against the official DFL net time stored in the
MatchInfo XML (`PlayingTimeFirstHalf` / `PlayingTimeSecondHalf` in milliseconds).

## Data Access

1. Go to the figshare repository for Bassek et al. (2025):
   https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28152671

2. Download all XML files for the 7 matches. The files follow this naming convention:
   ```
   DFL_02_01_matchinformation_<COM-ID>_<MAT-ID>.xml
   DFL_03_02_events_raw_<COM-ID>_<MAT-ID>.xml
   DFL_04_03_positions_raw_observed_<COM-ID>_<MAT-ID>.xml
   ```

3. Place all files in a **single flat folder** (no subfolders needed).

4. Open the notebook and set `DATA_DIR` in **Cell 4** to your folder path:
   ```python
   DATA_DIR = Path(r"C:\Users\yourname\Downloads\Bassek data")  # Windows
   DATA_DIR = Path("/Users/yourname/Downloads/Bassek data")      # Mac/Linux
   ```

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- See `requirements.txt` for full dependency list

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/net-time-assessment.git
cd net-time-assessment

# 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook NetTime_CodingAssessment.ipynb
```

### Conda (alternative)
```bash
conda create -n nettime python=3.10
conda activate nettime
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook NetTime_CodingAssessment.ipynb
```

## Known Issues & Notes

- **floodlight 0.4.0**: The `read_match_info_xml` function is not available in this
  version. A custom parser is implemented in the notebook (Cell 9).
- **Out-of-order events**: Some DFL event XML files contain out-of-order timestamps
  (late-logged events). The notebook handles this by anchoring half boundaries to
  `KickOff` and `FinalWhistle` gameclock values.
- **Player IDs in XY data**: The `players` attribute on XY objects is empty in
  floodlight 0.4.0. Players are indexed by column position (0–19 per team).
- **Data not included**: XML data files must be downloaded separately from figshare.
