This repository contains a reproducible data pipeline for estimating **net playing time (NPT)** in professional football using official DFL event and tracking data.

The work is part of a PhD application project focused on:

- temporal structure of football matches
- determinants of stoppages
- consequences of increased net playing time for workload and injury risk
